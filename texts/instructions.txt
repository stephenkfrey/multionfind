We are iterating through each profile to see if there is a match. Go through each profile.  DO NOT click the "Hire" or "Open in external Window" or "More Options" links. 

Look at the text and the skills described for a candidate. 

If they DON'T meet the "cool" criterion or they have one of the "Pass" criterion, then do nothing, move to the next candidate. 

IF they met "cool" and didn't have "pass" criteria, then: Click "Invite" button (it's labelled "invite <name> to job"), wait for the messaging modal to open. Remove any default message and send this message instead: 
---
{outreach_message} 
---

Then click the "Send Invitation button". 

Then, press the "Escape" key to close the modal. DO NOT click the next profile image until after you have pressed the "ESCAPE" key to close the modal. 

Ensure the profile modal is closed before continuing. 

Then move to repeat on the next candidate.
